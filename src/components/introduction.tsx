            In 2023, I celebrated ten years in my development career, six of which have been spent working on Shopify.

            I started off my career as an email developer, creating emails for the likes of nPower and Park Dean Resorts. I then moved into the agency world, working with a wide range of clients such as the NHS, the University of Leeds, and LVMH.

            I then moved into the world of Shopify, working for a number of agencies and freelancing for a number of clients. I have worked on a wide range of projects, from small theme tweaks to large scale migrations. Over the years I have gained a wealth of experience and knowledge, and I am always looking to learn more.

            As clich√© as it sounds, I am passionate about what I do. I love to learn new things and I am always looking to improve my skills.
