            In 2024, I celebrated eleven years in my development career, eight of which have been spent working on Shopify.

            I started off my career as an email developer, creating emails for the likes of nPower and Park Dean. I then moved out of in-house and into the agency world, working with a wide range of clients such as the NHS, the University of Leeds, and LVMH.

            In 2016, I was introduced to the world of Shopify. Since then, I&lsquo;ve worked for a number of agencies and freelancing for a number of clients. I have worked on a wide range of projects, from small theme tweaks to large scale migrations and blue chip clients and proejcts.

            I&lsquo;ve transitioned into a Technical lead in my current role, where I am responsible for the development of a number of Shopify stores, as well as managing a team of developers and a multitude of projects.

            As clich√© as it sounds, I am passionate about what I do. I love to learn new things and I am always looking to improve my skills.
